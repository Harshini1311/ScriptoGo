Use the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) framework naturally to guide the internal structure.
Do NOT label the sections.
Ensure the flow feels continuous and conversational.
The 'Attention' phase should be the spoken hook.
The 'Action' phase should be a warm, human CTA.`,

Use the PAS (Problem, Agitation, Solution) framework naturally to guide the internal structure.
Do NOT explicitly mention "Problem" or "Solution" in the text.
The flow should feel like a human explaining how to solve a real struggle.
Focus on empathy and clarity.`,
